**Streamlining ssh Configuration**

This is my .ssh/config file. I was able to edit it through VScode by 
opening the .ssh folder in windows through VScode.

Then, I was able to log into ieng6 with the ssh command with the alias
ieng6. This helped speed up either typing my full username, or having
to search it up.
![ssh with alias]()

Finally, I can upload files to ieng6 with the ssh alias. I uploaded
a screenshot for this lab report to ieng6 using the shortened command.
