1. **Installing VScode**
- VScode should be free to download by anybody. You can go to their [site](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click the "download" button. Then, click the relavant download button for your operating system (windows, mac, linux). The download then should be automatic.

2. **Remotely Connecting**
- You can remotely connect to the ieng6 server using the ssh command in your terminal. Your email to sign in starts with `cs15lwi22` followed by your personal code, plus `@ieng6@ucsd.edu`. The course specific code can be found at [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php), where you can create your password. Then, you can sign in to the server with the password.
